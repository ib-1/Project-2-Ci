## Goals
* Create a simple game of rock paper scissors lizard spock
* make the game have increasing levels of difficulty

* Use JavaScript to make the game responsive
* Test the game with users

## Functionality
### Load Screen

* On the load screen the user will see the title of the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" and a light blue section which contains the game, the first level will be level 1 and there will be 3 buttons for them to choose from being rock paper scissors (for the first level), and a big green submit button for them to submit thier choice.

* The user will see the instructions at the bottom of the page so they know how to play the game
